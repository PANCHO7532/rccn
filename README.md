### Note for myself, i should change this shit name for something more elegant
## UPDATE: Done changing name uwu
### WARNING: This was a private repository, i made it public because yes
This is crap, unstable shit code that i made for... eeeh, things.

Probably this will never be updated, or maybe yes but not at this time

### Deploy instructions (for avoid my brain forgetting this)
- git add .

Then, done.
